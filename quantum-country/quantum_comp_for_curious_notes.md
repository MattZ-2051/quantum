# Quantum Country Notes

## Part 1 - The state of a qubit

- The state of a qubit is a vector in a two-dimensional vector space. This vector space is known as state space
- Example ket 0 := [[1
               0]]
- This special state (ket 0) is called a computational basis state
- Example ket 1 := [[0
                  1]]
- Quantum states are represented by complex vector
- Quantum states as mathematical objects are 2D vectors in a complex vector space
- The sums of the squares of the amplitudes must be equal to 1 this is called the normalization constraint
- The quantum state of a qubit is a vector of unit length in a 2D complex vector space known as state space

## Part 2 - Introducing quantum logic gates

- A quantum logic gate is a way of manipulating quantum information, that is, the quantum state of a qubit or a collection of qubits
- Quantum wires are one of the hardest computations to implement because holding a quantum state is difficult as atoms and photons can be disturbed easily
